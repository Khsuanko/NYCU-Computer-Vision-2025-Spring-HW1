#Introduction
This project focuses on image classification using deep learning, specifically leveraging ResNet50. The task involves classifying images into 100 different categories. The primary goal is to train a robust model that can generalize well to unseen images. The core idea is to fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet50 model using a custom dataset while incorporating data augmentation and learning rate scheduling to improve performance.
